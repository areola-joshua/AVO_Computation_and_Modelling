🔍 AVO Analysis and Subsurface Characterization Tool 🌍

An advanced computational tool developed to streamline Amplitude Versus Offset (AVO) data analysis and enhance subsurface characterization. This tool leverages mathematical algorithms and Python libraries to optimize the interpretation of seismic data, providing insights for hydrocarbon exploration.

🎯 Focus
The project focuses on improving the analysis of AVO data by optimizing key parameters and applying advanced models to enhance subsurface interpretations.

⚡ Key Capabilities
1. AVO Tuning
Optimizes the AVO response by fine-tuning parameters to achieve greater accuracy in subsurface interpretations.
2. AVO Attribute Analysis
Extracts significant AVO attributes from well log and seismic data to identify potential hydrocarbon reservoirs.
3. Gassmann Fluid Modeling
Uses Gassmann's equations to predict fluid effects on seismic velocities and reflection coefficients, which aids in identifying fluids present in the reservoir.
4. Rock Physics Modeling
Models the relationship between rock properties and seismic response, enhancing lithology discrimination and providing crucial insights into reservoir characterization.
